# perldar

perldar is a Perl library (with samples) to gather status information from NETGEAR ReadyNAS RAID units and present or manipulate that information in a variety of ways.

(The project's title is a play on the name of the RAIDar tool used to manage the units from the operating system desktop.)

This project is only useful if you own NETGEAR ReadyNAS unit(s).

*NOTE: I no longer use ReadyNAS units so this is not going to be updated by me.  If someone wants to take over, let me know.*
