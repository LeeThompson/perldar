# perldar

perldar is a Perl library (with samples) to gather status information from NETGEAR ReadyNAS RAID units and present or manipulate that information in a variety of ways.

(The project's title is a play on the name of the RAIDar tool used to manage the units from the operating system desktop.)

This project is only useful if you own a NETGEAR ReadyNAS unit(s).
